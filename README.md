List Bullet Image
How do you do this?

You can make your lists look like the one above by using the list-style-image property.

Using list-style-image is similar to adding an image onto your page:

First, you need an image in your images folder that will be your bullet.

Next, you type the link to the image into your stylesheet.

You also need to remember that your image needs to be small enough to serve as a bullet.
ul{
list-style-image: url('images/pointer.png');
}
